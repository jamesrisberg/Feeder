## Twetter

Twetter is like Twitter but better.

One of Twitter's many (many, many, many) issues and the one I see as the most glaring is the inability to make custom feeds.
The deluge of content a user is faced with when they open the Twitter app is simultaneously overwhelming and useless. If I 
can't find the content I'm interested in within a sea of tweets, the service brings no value and I have no use for it. 

Twetter lets you define your own custom search queries with which to construct feeds of tweets based around your interests. 
Using any combonation of hastags and keywords, you can build any feed your heart desires, from the serious to the silly.

Sports lovers may want a feed fed from #NFL, #NHL, and #MLB. A political activist may be more interested in a feed fed from breakingnews, protest, or @CNN. Someone may even want a feed of every tweet that mentions pineapples. The possibilities are
endless.

Build a better Twitter. Use Twetter.
